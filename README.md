# **Overview**
This repository contains solutions to some Leetcode problems in either Kotlin, C++ or maybe both if I'm feeling cheeky. 

Personally I'm not a fan of these sorts of problems as they rarely translate to real-world skills, but whatever, these are required at almost every interview now.

**I'm storing these here for posterity.**

# **Solution**

Solutions are named as their Leetcode ID first, followed by the problem's name. You'll also find a link inside the solution files, should you be inclined to look at them.
